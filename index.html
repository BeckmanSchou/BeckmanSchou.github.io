I want others to describe me as someone who is always growing as a person, supports their community, and as someone who will always do whatever it takes to help out whoever I can. I will be focused on aligning my major and opportunities with my long-term career goals, while also having the ability to be flexible enough to adapt to new paths that peak my interest.</p>

                    The app opens up to the main interface and can direct the user
                    to multiple differnt parts of the app. A list of activities/goals,
                    a notification schedule, or another interface. The next interface can
                    then lead to more features like an AI chatbot that can help with fitness or mental health focused questions, 
                    a score tracker for how many points you have earned for tasks or goals you
                    have completed, and a feature that allows you to customize how the app looks
                    on a smart watch.
